AND MANY OTHER THINGS THAT I FORGOT ABOUT. 

I intend on updating Misery Mode to include more or less features, or fix some of the broken things.
When playing this addon, it is recommended but not required that you create a new world, as the addon does change world generation very slightly. If you put this addon onto an existing world, than make sure it is a world with experimental gameplay options enabled.

I'm about 90% sure that the only experimental gameplay options you need are:
-Creation of custom biomes
-Holiday creator features
Be sure to enable these as it will be broken without them
