# Misery-Mode
Repository for the Misery Mode project, a Minecraft Bedrock Edition difficulty mod.

Download the .mcaddon file and import this to MCBE. Enjoy.

I intend on updating Misery Mode to include more or less features, or fix some of the broken things. To, eventually, update your version of this addon, follow these steps:

1. Delete the previous version of this addon (behavior and resource) from MCBE, either from the files itself or in-game.
2. Replace it with the latest version. Again, this can be done from the files or in-game. If the latter, than just install from the .mcaddon again.
3. If you have created a world with this addon, than delete the old version of the addon from the world, preferablly using the world files.
4. Replace its BP and RP with the latest version. NOTE: you can individually download the BP and RP so you can manually replace each folder.
5. Exisiting entities, chunks, etc. in the world will not change. Only newly generated entities and chunks will have the changes.

As you can see, it is very simple to update.

When playing this addon, it is recommended but not required that you create a new world, as the addon does change world generation very slightly. If you put this addon onto an existing world, than make sure it is a world with experimental gameplay options enabled.

I'm about 90% sure that the only experimental gameplay options you need are:
-Creation of custom biomes
-Holiday creator features
Be sure to enable these as it will be broken without them
